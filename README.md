# alx-low_level_programming
### My first low level program

**ALX** low level programming course is an attempt for me to understand low level programming using the C programming language I'm excited to commence this journey as C is the mother of all modern languages and I'm excited to share this experience on My guitar page as I progress through learning and understanding low level programming.
